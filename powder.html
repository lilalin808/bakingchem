      <h1>Chemistry of Baking Powder</h1>

      <h2>What is Baking Powder?</h2>
      <p>
        Baking powder is a chemical leavening agent that contains both an acid
        and a base. It is used to create a light and fluffy texture in baked
        goods by producing carbon dioxide gas (CO₂) during mixing and baking.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s in Baking Powder?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Baking soda (NaHCO₃):</strong> The base.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dry acid:</strong> Such as monocalcium phosphate or sodium
          aluminum sulfate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Filler:</strong> Typically cornstarch, to absorb moisture and
          prevent premature reactions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>
      <p>
        When baking powder is mixed with liquid, an acid-base reaction takes
        place:
      </p>
      <p><code>NaHCO₃ + H⁺ → Na⁺ + CO₂↑ + H₂O</code></p>
      <p>
        The CO₂ gas creates bubbles that get trapped in the batter, causing it
        to expand and rise.
      </p>

      <h2>Single-Acting vs. Double-Acting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Single-acting:</strong> Reacts fully when mixed with liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Double-acting:</strong> Reacts in two phases — once when
          moistened, and again when heated in the oven or pan. This gives more
          consistent rise and is more commonly used.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Use Baking Powder Instead of Baking Soda?</h2>
      <p>
        Baking soda requires an external acid to react. Baking powder already
        contains the acid, making it more convenient in recipes that don't have
        enough natural acidity.
      </p>

      <div class="recipe">
        <h3>Example: Classic Chocolate Cake</h3>
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (non-alkalized)</li>
          <li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
          <li>1½ tsp baking soda</li>
          <li>2 cups sugar</li>
          <li>2 eggs</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
          <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
          <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
          <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> This recipe uses both baking powder and
          baking soda. The cocoa powder (if natural and not Dutch-processed) and
          milk provide mild acidity to activate the baking soda, while the
          baking powder ensures a second rise as the cake bakes.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Chemical Reactions:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Initial reaction with acidic ingredients:
          <br /><code>NaHCO₃ + H⁺ (from cocoa/milk) → CO₂↑ + H₂O + salt</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional reaction during heating (double-acting powder):
          <br /><code>NaHCO₃ + heat → Na₂CO₃ + CO₂↑ + H₂O</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          This combination results in a soft, moist cake with excellent volume.
