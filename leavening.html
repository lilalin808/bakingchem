      <h2>What are Leavening Agents?</h2>
      <p>
          Leavening agents are substances that cause doughs and batters to expand by releasing gases within the mixture. The resulting bubbles make baked goods lighter and softer in texture.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Leavening Agents</h2>
      <p>There are three major categories:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Biological:</strong> Yeast and bacteria produce CO₂ through fermentation of sugars.</li>
          <li><strong>Chemical:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder create gas through acid-base reactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Air or steam incorporated during mixing or baking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)</h2>
      <p>
          Baking soda is chemically known as <strong>sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃)</strong>. It is a base that reacts with acids to produce carbon dioxide (CO₂), water, and a salt. This gas gets trapped in the batter and expands when heated, causing the product to rise.
      </p>

      <h3>Acid-Base Reaction</h3>
      <p>
          When an acid such as vinegar (acetic acid), lemon juice (citric acid), or buttermilk (lactic acid) is added, the following reaction occurs:
      </p>
      <p>
          <code>NaHCO₃ + H⁺ → Na⁺ + CO₂↑ + H₂O</code>
      </p>
      <p>
          This is an instantaneous reaction — as soon as the acid and base are mixed, carbon dioxide begins to form.
      </p>

      <h3>Thermal Decomposition of Baking Soda</h3>
      <p>
          Even without an acidic ingredient, baking soda can release carbon dioxide when heated. This process is called <strong>thermal decomposition</strong> and occurs around 80°C (176°F) or higher:
      </p>
      <p>
          <code>2 NaHCO₃ → Na₂CO₃ + CO₂↑ + H₂O</code>
      </p>
      <p>
          In this reaction, sodium bicarbonate breaks down into sodium carbonate (a more bitter-tasting residue), carbon dioxide, and water vapor. 
      </p>

      <h2>Comparison with Baking Powder</h2>
      <p>
          Baking powder contains both an acid (usually cream of tartar or monocalcium phosphate) and a base (baking soda), along with a drying agent (typically cornstarch). It comes in two types:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Single-acting:</strong> Reacts upon moisture addition only.</li>
          <li><strong>Double-acting:</strong> Reacts in two stages — once when wet, and again when heated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Baking soda needs an acid to produce CO₂ efficiently for leavening.</li>
          <li>It can also decompose with heat, but this may affect taste and texture.</li>
          <li>Proper balance of ingredients is crucial for ideal rise and flavor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Make Honeycomb Toffee</h2>
      <p>Recipe from: https://www.seriouseats.com/blums-coffee-crunch-cake </p>
      <p>
        <div id="recipe">
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups (15.75 ounces) sugar</li>
<li>1/3 cup (2.66 ounces) strong brewed coffee</li>
<li>1/3 cup (3.75 ounces) light corn syrup</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons baking soda</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          
          <li>Attach a candy thermometer to the side of a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot. Add the sugar, coffee, and corn syrup to the pot, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a heatproof silicone spatula until the mixture reaches 270°F, about 10 minutes. </li>
          <img src="images/boiling.jpeg" alt="crunch" class="article-image" />

          <li>Meanwhile,  coat a 13-by-18-by-1-inch baking sheet with nonstick baking spray. Measure the baking soda into a ramekin or cup and place near the stovetop, along with a large whisk.</li>
          <li>When the crunch reaches 270°F, increase the heat to high and stir constantly until the crunch reaches 305°F. Remove from the heat and quickly whisk the baking soda into the crunch; the mixture will expand and aerate quickly, in a matter of seconds.
            </li>

          <li>Pour the crunch onto the baking sheet. Allow the crunch to cool, undisturbed, for at least 30 minutes before using a cleaver or other heavy knife to chop the toffee.</li>
